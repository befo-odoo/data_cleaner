# Data Cleaner Tool

The data cleaner module is designed to automate the process of cleaning client data, specifically product variants (attributes and values)

## Usage

To use the data cleaner, install the ```data_cleaning``` module from apps.

From there, upload a file, and then open the column mapping wizard by clicking the ```Map Fields``` button. Mark all of the columns that are attributes, and then close the wizard. Now, the file can be exported and all selected attributes will be formatted properly in the cleaned csv file.
